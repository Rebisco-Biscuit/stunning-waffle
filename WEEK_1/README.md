## Week 1
#### This is dedicated for Week 1, each day for an hour (or more), unsolved or not -- I'll solve a problem and update the md when the problem is answered. <br />
A - answered on the same day <br />
U - answered on the day but overdue for days <br />

- [x] Day 1: Swapping two integers using pointers. <b> A [2025 Mar 10] - Swap.c </b>
- [x] Day 2: Swapping two integers using function pointers. <b> A [2025 Mar 11] - FSwap.c </b><br />
        X : Advanced - Using qsort() to sort an array in descending order.
- [x] Day 3: Dynamic Memory Allocation & Structs. <br />
        / : Problem 1 - Write a function that dynamically allocates an integer array of size n, fills it with values from 1 to n, prints them, and then frees the memory. <b> A [2025 MAR 12] </b> <br />
        / : Problem 2 - Modify Problem 1 to allow the user to increase the array size using realloc(), appending new values to the end. <b> A [2025 MAR 12] - DMA.c </b><br /> 
        / : Problem 3 - Dynamically allocate memory for a student, store values, print the studentâ€™s info, and free the memory. <b> A [2025 MAR 12] - Structs.c </b><br />
        / : Advanced - Write a program that dynamically creates an array of students, stores multiple students, and prints their details. <b> A [2025 MAR 12] - Structs2.c </b> <br />
- [x] Day 4: Dynamic Memory & More Pointers. <b> A [2025 Mar 13] - 2D-Allocation.c </b> <br />
        / : F 1 - Write a function *int*** *create2DArray(int rows, int cols)* that dynamically allocates a *rows x cols* integer matrix and initializes each element to *(row_index + col_index)*. <br />
        / : F 2 - Write a function *void transposeMatrix(int*** *matrix, int rows, int cols)* that transposes a dynamically allocated matrix (convert *MxN* into *NxM*). <br />
        X : Advanced - Write a function *int*** *createJaggedArray(int rows, int* colSizes)* that creates a jagged 2D array where each row can have a different number of columns based on *colSizes*. <br />
        / : F 3 - Modify create2DArray() so that it takes user input instead of filling it with default values. <br />
        / : F 4 - Implement void *free2DArray(int*** *arr, int rows)* to correctly free a dynamically allocated 2D array.
- [ ] Day 5: Day 5: Strings and Dynamic Memory Manipulation <br />
        : F 1 - Dynamic String Concatenation <br />
        : F 2 - Reverse a String in Place (Dynamic Memory) <br />
        : F 3 - Find the Most Frequent Character <br />
        : Advanced - Dynamic String Expansion
