Hey God... its me again (DSA pt2) <br />

Anyway, I'm practicing ahead so that I can breeze through DSA this summer cause failing is not it, I dilly-dally'ed way too much and failed so here I am. <br />

That aside, the practices are from chatgpt bc I'm too lazy to find C language related problems that'll cater my needs and some are just a headache that I'd end up looking up the answers. <br />
Whatever though. Here's the agenda:
___
### Week 1: C Fundamentals & Complexity Analysis <br />
ðŸ”¹ Problems: <br />
Implement dynamic memory allocation for an array (malloc, calloc, free). Write a function pointer for sorting (use qsort). <br />
Analyze the time complexity of: <br />
A single loop (for (i = 0; i < n; i++)) <br /> 
A nested loop (for (i = 0; i < n; i++) for (j = 0; j < n; j++)) <br />
A recursive function (e.g., Fibonacci) <br />

___
### Week 2: Linked Lists <br />
ðŸ”¹ Problems: <br />
Implement a singly linked list with insert, delete, and traverse functions. Implement a doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal. Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively. <br />
Detect a cycle in a linked list (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm). <br />

### Week 4: Trees (Binary Trees & BST) <br /> 
ðŸ”¹ Problems: <br />
Implement a binary tree with Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals. <br />
Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, and search functions. <br />
Find the height of a binary tree. <br />
Check if a binary tree is balanced (Hint: Use height difference). <br />
