hey god... its me again (DSA pt2)
---
Anyway, I'm practicing ahead so that I can breeze through DSA this summer cause failing is not it, I dilly-dally'ed way too much so here I am.
That aside, the practices are from chatgpt bc I'm too lazy to find C language related problems that'll cater my needs and some are just a waste of my time and won't help me any better.
Whatever though. Here's the agenda:
---
### Week 1: C Fundamentals & Complexity Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Problems:
Implement dynamic memory allocation for an array (malloc, calloc, free).
Write a function pointer for sorting (use qsort).
Analyze the time complexity of:
A single loop (for (i = 0; i < n; i++))
A nested loop (for (i = 0; i < n; i++) for (j = 0; j < n; j++))
A recursive function (e.g., Fibonacci)
ðŸ“š Resources:
Pointers in C (GeeksforGeeks)
Big O Notation (Khan Academy)
---
### Week 2: Linked Lists
ðŸ”¹ Problems:
Implement a singly linked list with insert, delete, and traverse functions.
Implement a doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal.
Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively.
Detect a cycle in a linked list (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm).
ðŸ“š Resources:
Linked Lists in C (GeeksforGeeks)
Detect a Cycle in a Linked List (Leetcode)
---
### Week 3: Stacks, Queues & Recursion
ðŸ”¹ Problems:
Implement a stack using an array and a linked list.
Implement a queue using an array and a linked list.
Solve Tower of Hanoi recursively.
Write a recursive function for factorial and Fibonacci.
ðŸ“š Resources:
Stack in C (Programiz)
Queue in C (Programiz)
Recursion Basics (Khan Academy)
---
### Week 4: Trees (Binary Trees & BST)
ðŸ”¹ Problems:
Implement a binary tree with Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals.
Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, and search functions.
Find the height of a binary tree.
Check if a binary tree is balanced (Hint: Use height difference).
ðŸ“š Resources:
Binary Tree Traversal (GeeksforGeeks)
Binary Search Tree (Programiz)
---
### Week 5: Sorting, Searching & Hashing
ðŸ”¹ Problems:
Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
Implement Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive).
Implement a Hash Table using chaining or open addressing.
ðŸ“š Resources:
Sorting Algorithms Visualized (Sorting Algorithms)
Hashing Basics (GeeksforGeeks)
---
### Week 6: Graphs & Dynamic Programming
ðŸ”¹ Problems:
Implement a graph using an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list.
Implement BFS and DFS traversal for a graph.
Implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for the shortest path.
Solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming.
ðŸ“š Resources:
Graph Representation (GeeksforGeeks)
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Programiz)
Dynamic Programming Intro (Khan Academy)
